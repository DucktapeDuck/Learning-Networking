# Learning-Networking

Creating this repository to just create an open area where my learning doesn't go to waste with all of this stuff.

I plan to have a few things in here, mostly stuff I learn about creating connections using python and then using that connection to be able to communicate information.

I hope that this repository can provide some other people the insight that I wish I had. (haha). I plan to link all the resources that I found helpful.

    - The following link is basically what started me on my learning path. This tutorial offers you some insight into the very basics of socket programming and allows you to have some insight on the process. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGCbpkBEMiCaiu_3OL-_Bz_8
    - The following link is a how to on socket programming. It is relatively simple and offers a great transition to the next resource https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html
    - This following link should offer you everything that you need to know with sockets in python.
    
To be honest, I have no idea how active I am going to be on this but I hope to be an active member with this site. I am mostly using this as therapy to allow me to think over things. I am also very new to this site, so please take care of me.

Thanks, 
Connor
